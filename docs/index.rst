Welcome to yt_xarray's documentation!
======================================


yt_xarray streamlines communication between
`xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#>`_ and
`yt <https://yt-project.org>`_,
making it easier use yt's visualization and analysis methods with data
loaded via xarray.

Presently, yt_xarray primarily adds methods to generate a yt dataset from a
subset of xarray dataset fields, without making copies of data when possible.

After installing, the easiest way to get started is to peruse the
:ref:`Example Notebooks`.
If you come across any issues or have feature requests, please reach out at the
`yt_xarray github repository <https://github.com/data-exp-lab/yt_xarray/>`_!
